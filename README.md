# Graphode
The aim of Graphode is to build a set of call graphs for each .NET application that it analyzes and store those graphs in your technology of choice such as Neo4j, Gephi etc. There are many call graph tools out there already, what makes Graphode interesting is that it:
- optionally includes accesses to external resources such as databases, web services, queues etc.
- can be integrated into a build system
- it has no visualization technology itself, it simply generates graphs for powerful graph technologies that allow you to query the data in the way you want to.
